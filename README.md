# BeloScript

This is an extension that helps with writing BeloScript, my stupid programming language. Provides syntax highlighting and some snippets. No smart features here.

## Features

* Syntax highlighting
* Snippets
* Command to run the scripts

## Requirements

BeloScript installed on your system.

## Extension Settings
* BeloScript executable location. Default is PATH, which assumes that you have BeloScript in your path environmental variable. Otherwise set it to something like: C:/Program Files/BeloScript/BeloScript.exe

## Known Issues

This sucks
